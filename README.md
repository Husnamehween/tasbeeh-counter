Title: Tasbeeh Counter - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

Welcome to my Tasbeeh Counter project repository! ðŸ“¿
This project is a digital Tasbeeh counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a convenient way for users to perform their Tasbeeh (the repetitive utterance of short sentences glorifying God) digitally, enhancing accessibility and usability for individuals in their spiritual practices.
